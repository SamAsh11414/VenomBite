# VenomBite
I simple virus script in python, 

*DON'T USE UNLESS YOU ARE EXPERIENCED WITH A CODING LANGUAGE AND KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING*

I would not use this in a main directory unless you want to look through every python file in the directory to make sure nothing of it is left.

How to use in a controlled manner:
    1. Make sure the files located on github are inside of a folder, I designed the virus not to leave the folder that it is placed in, it will only attack files located within the folder.
    2. Open an IDE software, VS code is recommended because that is where it was created
    3. Deside which program you would like to infect by draging it out of the file called "Test_Subjects" and into the same folder as "main.py"
    4. Run the "main.py" file in your IDE. 
    5. Open your test subject to find it has been infected with the VenomBite.

Some things to note:
    - I lowered the effect it would have on the files so that the risk to users (If the virus is used incorrectly) would be insignificant. So don't expect any fireworks haha.
    - I ask that no one use this script to inflict harm on others, while this may seem harmless I am sure if someone put their mind to it, they could do some damage.
    - Have fun, I made this as a side project. I only made it with the intention of education and enjoyment.
